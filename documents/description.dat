J.A. Harill et al. \cite{1} used automated mechanisms to analyze high-content images while studying 
the chemical effects on synapse development. They used proprietory software provided by Cellomics 
for their analysis. S.K.Schmitz et al. \cite{2} developed an image analysis routine SynD that can 
automate the analysis of neuronal morphology. Though automated, SynD allows user interaction during 
all its detection phases. The authors point out that an important aspect of SynD is its ability 
to report the number of detected synapses as a function of distance from the soma. They also mention 
that SynD can measure expression level of proteins of interest in the detected synapses. It can 
compare this synaptic level with that in the cell soma.

Figure 1 (flow chart) gives a detailed view of our image analysis framework. It is extremely 
lightweight with low memory footprint. It has been designed with scalibility in mind i.e. capable 
of coarse-grained parallel processing of huge number of images related to neuronal morphology. The 
framework can process images without any human supervision. It separates out a 3-D high-content 
image into a series of 2-D dimensional z-stack layers. For each layer, the constituent red, green 
and blue channels are analyzed separately. After grayscale convertion, each channel is transformed 
into a negative. This allows us to use low-pass filters to retain the significant areas of interest 
in that channel. In case of the blue and green channels, the filtered negative is reversed which 
reveals the significant features needed for our analysis. Data from contour analysis of the blue 
and green channels are used to count the number of cells in that image and also allows us to 
categorize cells as either neurons or astrocytes. A blue channel contour with significant green 
channel overlap is considered to be a neuron. This categorization mechanism is further refined by 
using the dimension aspect ratio of cells. An elongated cell (with small dimension aspect ratio) 
is usually an astrocyte.

The red channels (high and low intensity) are analyzed for information about the synapses. The high 
intensity red channel can be obtained by reversing the filtered negative of the red channel. The 
low intensity content can be derived by feeding the filtered negative through a second filter, this 
time a band-pass filter. Contour properties of both high and low intensity channels serve as an 
important metric in our anaysis. The overlap regions between green and both red channels (high and 
low) are also analyzed for their size.

Metric values are calculated by the framework during image analysis. Some of the prominent metrics 
used are:

-> Cell count for neurons and astrocytes - individual and total counts
-> Number of astrocytes within close proximity of any neuron (mean and standard deviation)
-> High and low intensity synapse regions - individual and total count
-> Categorize high and low intensity synapse regions into different bins based on their size
-> Green-red(high and low) intersection - individual and total count of regions
-> Categorize green-red(high and low) intersection regions into different bins based on their size

This image analysis framework was developed using OpenCV version 2.4.9.
